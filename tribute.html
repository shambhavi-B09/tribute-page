    <p><b>Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel</b>,commonly known as Sardar Patel,was an Indian lawyer, influential political
        leader,
        barrister and statesman who served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India from 1947 to
        1950. He was a barrister and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a leading role in the
        country's struggle for independence, guiding its integration into a united, independent nation.In India and
        elsewhere, he was often called Sardar, meaning "chief" in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Persian. He acted as the Home
        Minister during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.

        Patel was born in Nadiad, Kheda district, and raised in the countryside of the state of Gujarat. He was a
        successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda,
        Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the
        most influential leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress,
        organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937 while promoting the Quit India Movement.

        As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for partition
        refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace. He led the task of forging a
        united India, successfully integrating into the newly independent nation those British colonial provinces that
        formed the Dominion of India.Besides those provinces that had been under direct British rule, approximately 565
        self-governing princely states had been released from British suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act of 1947.
        Patel persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India. His commitment to national integration in the
        newly independent country was total and uncompromising, earning him the sobriquet "Iron Man of India". He is
        also remembered as the "patron saint of India's civil servants" for having established the modern All India
        Services system.

        The Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue which was erected by the Indian government at a cost of US$420
        million, was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018 and is approximately 182 metres (597 ft) in heigh

    <p>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a charismatic leader who spoke his mind and valued the views of those who disagreed
        with him, believed strongly in the unity of Indians who fought the British together and their determination to
        advance from 'Swarajya' to 'Surajya.' He was an outspoken supporter of women's liberation and self-sufficiency
        as a result of rapid industrialization.
        Sardar Patel became a supporter of Mahatma Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement and began wearing only khadi
        clothes. He rose to the topmost of the Indian National Congress, where he organized the party for elections in
        1934 and 1937 while also promoting the Quit India Movement.
        Sardar Patel used diplomacy, mediation, and foresight to get the various princely states into the Indian Union
        without bloodshed. His most lasting legacy is his attempts to unite a dispersed country, where his persuasive
        skills and statesmanship were put to the test. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was tasked with the monumental mission
        of political integration in India, and he is in responsible of uniting the country's 562 princely states.
        Hence, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was called the "Iron Man of India" for his unwavering attempts to integrate the
        princely states into the Indian federation.
